## Module 1 Summary: HTML Overview

In this module, you learned that:

    HTML provides the basic structure and content for a website using tags.

    Tags represent the elements of an HTML page.

    The HTML DOM Tree describes how a website is structured.

    HTML uses APIs to enhance the user experience, providing features for advanced animation, audio, and video.

    Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites.

    It is recommended to not rely on scripting as it can be disabled.

    HTML5 sandboxes help manage iframe mashups.

    HTML5 Browser Support Tables describe which browsers support which HTML5 features.

    JavaScript is used to check if an element is supported by a browser.

    CSS provides consistent style and design throughout the website.

    There are two types of CSS layouts to design websites: fluid and fixed.
